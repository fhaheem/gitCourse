\subsection{Introduction: Why do we need Git?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Git is a state of the art version control system that is used in the vast majority of projects.
    \item Git: A system that is used to track changes in your files. 
    \item It allows you to see changes over time, undo and redo changes and make sure that all versions of file is saved so nothing is ever lost.
    \item Github is an online service that allows you to store your saved files and all their versions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Git and Github}
Case: Your boss asks you to remove a page from their website but regrets and asks you to put it back exactly how it was. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Git maintains a copy of every file in your project at anytime. 
    \item Every time you modify any file in any way and commit your changes, Git will track it. Both versions are never lost. 
    \item Revert back to V1, instead of V2.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Create a GitHub Repository}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A github repository is a folder where we want to track file changes and file versioning. 
\end{itemize}
